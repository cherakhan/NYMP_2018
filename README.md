# Logistic Regression for Differential Expression
This GitHub repository contains the code for reproducing the analysis and figures in [Ntranos, Yi et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0303-9). Parts of the analysis were performed in python and others in R.

## Getting Started
For tutorials on using logistic regression for CD45, one can use 10x_example-logR.

For the simulations and analysis in R, simulations/RSEM/R provides the R code for performing logistic regression. The Snakefile contains an overview of the workflow, from creating the simulations to running the analysis and plotting benchmark curves.

## Accessing simulation data
Due to the large size of the simulations, we placed the quantifications and counts for the simulations in a separate figshare repository: https://figshare.com/articles/Single_Cell_RNA-Seq_Simulations_for_Ntranos_Yi_et_al_2019/7108364
